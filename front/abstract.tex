We are living in the big data age: An ever increasing amount of data is being
produced through data acquisition and computer simulations. While large scale
analysis and simulations have received significant attention for cloud and
high-performance computing, software to efficiently visualize large data sets
is struggling to keep up.

Visualization has proven to be an efficient tool for understanding data, in
particular visual analysis is a powerful tool to gain intuitive insight into
the spatial structure and relations of 3D data sets. Large-scale visualization
setups are becoming ever more affordable, and high-resolution tiled display
walls are in reach even for small institutions. Virtual reality has arrived in
the consumer space, making it accessible to a large audience.

This thesis addresses these developments by advancing the field of parallel
rendering. We formalize the design of system software for large data
visualization through parallel rendering, provide a reference implementation of
a parallel rendering framework, introduce novel algorithms to accelerate the
rendering of large amounts of data, and validate this research and development
with new applications for large data visualization. Applications built using
our framework enable domain scientists and large data engineers to better
extract meaning from their data, making it feasible to explore more data and
enabling the use of high-fidelity visualization installations to see more
detail of the data.
