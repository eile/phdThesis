% 16-Sep-86, original version by Susan King and Oren Patashnik.
% 13-Oct-87 changes:
%	Fixed bug in last line by adding the {} that disappeard when
%		the \hbox{} was removed from the pre-APALIKE definition;
%	added club and widow penalties;
%	patched the \newblock LaTeX bug from `-.07em' to simply `.07em';
%	and made this work for document styles that don't define `chapter'.
%
%

% `; ' goes between cites, and there's no \hbox around individual cites
